**Truthify - Part of the ConsumeWise Initiative**

Truthify is a consumer-focused application that enhances transparency in packaged food products by verifying health-related claims. The project is part of the broader ConsumeWise initiative, helping users make informed, healthier choices by analyzing ingredients and claims made by food products.

## **Features**

- **Web Scraping**: Automatically retrieve a list of ingredients from the web using ZenRows and BeautifulSoup based on user input (product name).
- **Manual Input**: Users can manually enter the list of ingredients if scraping is not available.
- **Claim Verification**: The app verifies product claims like "boosts height" or "supports weight loss" by assessing the ingredients.
- **Verdict Generation**: A clear verdict is provided, indicating whether the productâ€™s health claims are truthful or misleading.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Flask API for managing requests, processing data, and running the claim verification logic.
- **Frontend**: Built using React.js and EJS for rendering pages like user searches and prediction results.
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup and ZenRows for fetching ingredient data from external sources.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL managed with pgAdmin 4 for storing products, users, and search logs.
- **Deployment**: Docker is used to manage the client and server-side services.

## **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- pgAdmin 4

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1**: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aaditbhandarii/GenAI.git
cd GenAI
```

### **Step 2**: Set Up PostgreSQL Database

1. Open **pgAdmin 4** and connect to your PostgreSQL server. 
2. Run the following SQL queries to create the necessary tables for the application:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(255),
    product_brand VARCHAR(255),
    ingredients TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE user_searches (
    search_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),
    product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),
    search_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE (user_id, product_id)
);

CREATE TABLE users( 
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
    username VARCHAR(255), 
    email VARCHAR(255), 
    password_hash TEXT 
);
```

### **Step 3**: Create `.env` Files

Make two `.env` files: one inside the `client` folder and the other inside the `server` folder with the following structure:

```
API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
ZENROWS_KEY=your_zenrows_api_key
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_pass
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
DB_PORT=5432
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret
```

### **Step 4**: Start Docker

1. Start your Docker Desktop.
2. Run the following command in your CLI in the GenAI folder:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -->
Certainly! Here's a single markdown file that you can copy, paste, and push directly to your repository. This file combines all the information into a well-structured README.md:
